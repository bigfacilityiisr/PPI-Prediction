# PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION PREDICTION

This repository contains model and code for predicting protein-protein interaction by inputing protein sequence.

The trained model is implemented using stramlit applet and can be accesed through https://ppi-prediction-3nxezkuhkspsbkvxwdixvc.streamlit.app/ and the interaction between two proteins can be predicted by uploading their corresponding sequnces.

The model is trained on a dataset of 5000 protein sequnces retrived from uniport. The datasset was trained with diffrent ML algorithms and the best model was selected for the deploying the in the applet. LGBM algorithm showed the best perfomance on the datset compared to SVM and XGB. 

## Abstract of the study
In this study, we evaluated the performance of machine learning techniques on the protein-protein interaction prediction using sequential data. By employing diverse computational instruments and methods, our objective was to enhance the understanding of PPIs and how well they can be predicted with machine learning techniques. A strong dataset was used to train and evaluate the model, and satisfactory performance metrics were obtained. Cross-validation methods were used to make sure the model could be used to a wide range of scenarios. The findings show that machine learning techniques have the capacity to anticipate PPIs, providing information that may guide future research and biotechnological applications.
