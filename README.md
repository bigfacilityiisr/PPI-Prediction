# PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION PREDICTION

This repository contains model and code for predicting protein-protein interaction by inputing protein sequence.

The trained model is implemented using stramlit applet and can be accesed through https://ppi-prediction-3nxezkuhkspsbkvxwdixvc.streamlit.app/ and the interaction between two proteins can be predicted by uploading their corresponding sequnces.

The model is trained on a dataset of 5000 protein sequnces retrived from uniport. The dataset was
